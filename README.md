##Assumptions

Using Siri in IOS 9.3.1 as the primary oracle when determining certain behaviours, the following assumptions have been made:
- words are case insensitive
- accented characters are treated the same as their non-accented equivalent


##Issues

- Apostrophes (ie Italian's) will currently be removed, leaving Italians, but this will not match unless Italians is present in the dataset.
